	<h1>Menu.js</h1>
	<p>
		Menu.js is a library for easily creating both static and dynamic menu interfaces.
	</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		The only other library that Menu.js requires is jQuery.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, you must include the menu.js script file after the "body" element of your document. Make sure to include a link to the "style.css" file as well.
	</p>
	<h2>Creating a Menu</h2>
	<p>
		Menus are created using javascript, using the <span class="javascript">new Menu(arguments)</span> constructor. The constructor takes an associative array as its one argument. The array has a few required properties and many optional properties. Here is the structure of the array.
	</p>
	<pre>
		var arguments = {
			id: "unique_html_id", //REQUIRED
			items: array_of_objects, //REQUIRED
			getItemText: function(item){ //REQUIRED
				//returns the text that should be displayed for the menu item representing the item paramater
			},
			getDescriptionText: function(item){ //OPTIONAL
				//returns the description text that should be displayed for the menu item representing the item paramater
			},
			title: "Menu Title", //OPTIONAL
			openWith: keyCode, //OPTIONAL
			width: 40, //OPTIONAL
			height: 40, //OPTIONAL
			onEnter: function(){ //OPTIONAL
				//This will be called when the user hits the enter key with this menu open.
			}
			wrap: true, //OPTIONAL
		};
		new Menu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<p>
		Instead of supplying the menu item text directly in the arguments, you supply a reference to an array of objects. You're probably wondering where the text of the menu item comes from. It comes from a the required argument "getItemText". This argument is a method that that takes an object as an argument, and returns the text that should be displayed on the menu item representing that object. When the menu is being generated or updated, the menu controller will iterate through each item in the items array and feed the item into "getItemText" to determine what text should be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		The "title" attribute determines the title of the menu. This will be displayed as a header above the menu items.
	</p>
	<p>
		The "open-with" attribute is optional. You can set it to the <a href="http://keycode.info/">keycode</a> of the key you would like to be able to open the menu with. The only keycodes you cannot use are 27 (escape key), 38 (up arrow), and 40 (down arrow).
	</p>
	<p>
		The width and height attributes correspond to the size of the menu as a percent of the page width and height respectively. They both must be even numbers less than or equal to 100. If left blank, they will revert to default values. The default width is 50%, and the default height is "as big as it needs to be but not too big".
	</p>
	<p>
		To have the menu do something when you hit enter, you can set the "onEnter" property of the arguments array to the function you would like to execute to be executed. You can access the index of the selected item with the 
		<span class="javascript">this.getSelectedIndex()</span> method. You can get the text of the selected menu item with the 
		<span class="javascript">this.getSelectedText()</span> method. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The "wrap" attribute has to do with the behavior of item selection. It can be either true or false. If true, the menu "wraps", meaning that if the last item is selected and the user hits the down arrow, the top item will be selected, and if the top item is selected and the user hits up, the bottom item will be selected. If false, nothing will happen in these scenarios. If unspecified, the menu will wrap by default.
	</p>
	<h2>A Concrete Example</h2>
	<p>
		Let's say you had an array of "person" objects called "people". Each "person" has multiple properties associated with it, such as "firstName", "lastName", "email", etc. Let's say you want to set up a menu where each person in the array is represented by a menu item, and you want the text of each menu item to be the corresponding person's first name followed by a space followed by their last name. And let's say you wanted the description to display the person's full name as a header, with the word "email" followed by their email address bellow. And let's say you want to write the selected person's first name to the console when you hit the enter key. You might set up something like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		function Person(firstName, lastName, email)
		{
			this.firstName = firstName;
			this.lastName = lastName;
			this.email = email;
		}
		var arguments = {
			id: "people_menu",
			items: people,
			getItemText: function(item)
			{
				return item.firstName + " " + item.lastName;
			},
			getDescriptionText: function(item)
			{
				var descriptionText = "&lt;h1&gt;" + item.firstName + " " + item.lastName + "&lt;\h1&gt;"; 
				descriptionText += "&lt;div&gt;Email: " + item.email + "&lt;\div&gt;";
				return descriptionText;
			},
			onEnter: function()
			{
				var selectedPerson = people[this.getSelectedIndex()];
				console.log(selectedPerson.firstName);
			}
		};
		new DynamicMenu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<p>
		With this setup, your menu will automatically update itself based on the "person" objects in the people array.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the "items" array changes while the menu is open and you want the menu to reflect the changes, call the menu's <span class="javascript">update()</span> method. 
	</p>


	<h2>Using a Menu</h2>
	<h3>Accessing a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		When your document loads, abstract javascript models of your menus will be created. You can access them with the
		<span class="javascript">global_menus</span> variable. 
		To access your menu objects, use <span class="javascript">global_menus.getMenu(MENU_ID)</span>. 
		This function returns the menu object corresponding to the id you feed it!
	</p>
	<h3>Opening and Closing a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		There are two ways to open or close a menu. If you set the "keycode" argument when creating the menu, simply press the key corresponding to that keycode to open or close the menu. If you didn't set that argument, you can call the function <span class="javascript">global_menus.toggle(MENU_ID)"</span> to open or close your menu.
		You can only have one menu open at a time. If you try to open a menu while another menu is open, nothing will happen.
	</p>
	<h3>Selecting Items in a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		By default, the first item in a menu is selected. To select a different item, use the up and down arrow keys.
	</p>
