	<h1>Menu.js</h1>
	<p>
		Menu.js is a library for easily creating both static and dynamic menu interfaces.
	</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		The only other library that Menu.js requires is jQuery.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, you must include the menu.js script file after the "body" element of your document. Make sure to include a link to the "style.css" file as well.
	</p>
	<h2>Creating a Menu</h2>
	<p>
		Menus are created using javascript, using the <span class="javascript">new Menu(arguments)</span> constructor. The constructor takes an associative array as its one argument. The array has a few required properties and many optional properties. Here is the structure of the array.
	</p>
	<pre>
		var arguments = {
			id: "unique_html_id", //REQUIRED
			items: array_of_objects, //REQUIRED
			getItemText: function(item){ //REQUIRED
				//returns the text that should be displayed for the menu item representing the item paramater
			},
			getDescriptionText: function(item){ //OPTIONAL
				//returns the description text that should be displayed for the menu item representing the item paramater
			},
			title: "Menu Title", //OPTIONAL
			openWith: keyCode, //OPTIONAL
			width: 40, //OPTIONAL
			maxItemsDisplayed: 10, //OPTIONAL
			wrap: true, //OPTIONAL
			onEnter: function(selectedItem){ //OPTIONAL
				//This will be called when the user hits the enter key with this menu open.
			}
		};

		new Menu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<h3>Arguments</h3>
	<p><b>id:</b> A unique menu id assigned to the corresponding menu html element.
	</p>
	<p><b>items:</b> An array containing the menu items, or the objects that will be used to generate the menu item data.
	</p>
	<p><b>getItemText:</b> A method that that takes a menu item (from the aformentioned "items" array) as an argument, and returns the text that should be displayed for the menu item corresponding to that object. When the menu is being generated or updated, the menu controller will iterate through each item in the items array and feed the item into this method to determine what text should be used.
	</p>
	<p><b>getDescriptionText:</b> This method operates very similarly to getItemText. Just like getItemText, this method is fed an item from the "items" array. Instead of outputting the corresponding menu item text, it outputs the corresponding description text for that item. This is an optional argument. If it is not included in the arguments array, the menu will not be displayed with a description box. 
	</p>
	<p><b>title:</b> Determines the titleof the menu. This will be displayed as a header above the menu items.
	</p>
	<p><b>openWith:</b> The key you would like to be able to open and close the menu with. So if you would like the menu to be opened with the "a" key, set the attribute to "a". The only keys you cannot use here are "Escape", "ArrowUp", and "ArrowDown".
	</p>
	<p><b>width:</b> Corresponds to the width of the menu as a percent of the page width. It must be an even number less than or equal to 100. If the argument is not included in the arguments array, the width of the menu will be 50%.
	</p>
	<p><b>maxItemsDisplayed:</b> The maximum numbers of menu items displayed at one time. If set to a number less than the total number of menu items, the menu items will scroll. If not set, all the menu items will be displayed on the page at the same time. 
	</p>
	<p><b>wrap:</b> Determines whether menu selection wraps or not. If set to true, when the last menu item is selected and the user hits the down arrow, the top menu item will be selected. Additionally, when the top menu item is selected and the user hits the up arrow, the last menu item will be selected. If set to false, nothing will happen in these scenarios. If not set, the menu will wrap. 
	</p>
	<p><b>onEnter:</b> A function that will be executed when the menu is open and the user hits the enter key. The currently selected item (from the "items" array that you fed into the arguments array) will be fed into this method. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>A Concrete Example</h2>
	<p>
		Let's say you had an array of "person" objects called "people". Each "person" has multiple properties associated with it, such as "firstName", "lastName", "email", etc. Let's say you want to set up a menu where each person in the array is represented by a menu item, and you want the text of each menu item to be the corresponding person's first name followed by a space followed by their last name. And let's say you wanted the description to display the person's full name as a header, with the word "email" followed by their email address bellow. And let's say you want to write the selected person's first name to the console when you hit the enter key. You might set up something like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		function Person(firstName, lastName, email)
		{
			this.firstName = firstName;
			this.lastName = lastName;
			this.email = email;
		}
		var arguments = {
			id: "people_menu",
			items: people,
			getItemText: function(item)
			{
				return item.firstName + " " + item.lastName;
			},
			getDescriptionText: function(item)
			{
				var descriptionText = "&lt;h1&gt;" + item.firstName + " " + item.lastName + "&lt;\h1&gt;"; 
				descriptionText += "&lt;div&gt;Email: " + item.email + "&lt;\div&gt;";
				return descriptionText;
			},
			onEnter: function(selectedPerson)
			{
				
				console.log(selectedPerson.firstName);
			}
		};
		new DynamicMenu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<p>
		With this setup, your menu will automatically update itself based on the "person" objects in the people array.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the "items" array changes while the menu is open and you want the menu to reflect the changes, call the menu's <span class="javascript">update()</span> method. 
	</p>


	<h2>Using a Menu</h2>
	<h3>Accessing a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		When your document loads, abstract javascript models of your menus will be created. You can access them with the
		<span class="javascript">global_menus</span> variable. 
		To access your menu objects, use <span class="javascript">global_menus.getMenu(MENU_ID)</span>. 
		This function returns the menu object corresponding to the id you feed it!
	</p>
	<h3>Opening and Closing a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		There are two ways to open or close a menu. If you set the "openWith" argument when creating the menu, simply press the key corresponding to that keycode to open or close the menu. If you didn't set that argument, you can call the function <span class="javascript">global_menus.toggle(MENU_ID)"</span> to open or close your menu.
		You can only have one menu open at a time. If you try to open a menu while another menu is open, nothing will happen. The escape key also closes whatever menu you have open. 
	</p>
	<h3>Selecting Items in a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		By default, the first item in a menu is selected. To select a different item, use the up and down arrow keys.
	</p>
