	<h1>Menu.js</h1>
	<p>
		Menu.js is a library for easily creating both static and dynamic menu interfaces.
	</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		The only other library that Menu.js requires is jQuery.
	</p>
	<h2>Static Menus</h2>
	<p>Menu.js includes both static and dynamic menus. We'll explore static menus first.</p>
	<h3>Creating a Static Menu</h3>
	<p>
		Static menus are created with javascript, using the StaticMenu() constructor.
	</p>
	<p>
		The StaticMenu() constructor takes an associative array as its one argument. The array has a couple required properties and many optional properties. Here is the structure of the array.
	</p>
	<pre>
		var arguments = {
			id: "unique_html_id", //REQUIRED
			items: ["Item 1 text", "Item 2 text", . . . "Item n text"], //REQUIRED. 
			descriptions: ["Description of Item 1", "Description of Item 2", . . . "Description of Item n"], //OPTIONAL
			title: "Menu Title", //OPTIONAL
			openWith: keyCode, //OPTIONAL
		};
		new StaticMenu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<p>
		The order of the key/value pairs does not matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		The "open-with" attribute is optional. You can set it to the <a href="http://keycode.info/">keycode</a> of the key you would like to be able to open the menu with. The only keycodes you cannot use are 27 (escape key), 38 (up arrow), and 40 (down arrow).
	</p>



	<h2>Dynamic Menu</h2>
	<p>
		Dynamic menus work almost the same as static menus. The difference is, you can link a dynamic menu to an array of objects, and the menu text will be filled and updated based on those objects.
	</p>
	<h3>Creating a Dynamic Menu</h3>
	<p>
		Dynamic menus can only be created using javascript. The process is almost the same as creating a static menu with javascript. But there are some extra paramaters required. 
	</p>
	<pre>
		var arguments = {
			id: "unique_html_id", //REQUIRED
			items: array_of_objects, //REQUIRED
			getItemText: function(item){ //REQUIRED
				//returns the text that should be displayed for the menu item representing the item paramater
			},
			getDescriptionText: function(item){ //OPTIONAL
				//returns the description text that should be displayed for the menu item representing the item paramater
			},
			title: "Menu Title", //OPTIONAL
			openWith: keyCode, //OPTIONAL
		};
		new DynamicMenu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<p>
		Instead of supplying the menu item text directly in the arguments, you supply a reference to an array of objects. You're probably wondering where the text of the menu item comes from. It comes from a the required argument "getItemText". This argument is a method that that takes an object as an argument, and returns the text that should be displayed on the menu item representing that object. When the menu is being generated or updated, the menu controller will iterate through each item in the items array and feed the item into "getItemText" to determine what text should be used.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, let's say you had an array of "person" objects called "people". Each "person" has multiple properties associated with it, such as "firstName", "lastName", "email", etc. Let's say you want to set up a menu where each person in the array is represented by a menu item, and you want the text of each menu item to be the corresponding person's first name followed by a space followed by their last name. And let's say you wanted the description to display the person's full name as a header, with the word "email" followed by their email address bellow. You might set up something like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
		function Person(firstName, lastName, email)
		{
			this.firstName = firstName;
			this.lastName = lastName;
			this.email = email;
		}
		var arguments = {
			id: "people_menu",
			items: people,
			getItemText: function(item)
			{
				return item.firstName + " " + item.lastName;
			},
			getDescriptionText: function(item)
			{
				var descriptionText = "&lt;h1&gt;" + item.firstName + " " + item.lastName + "&lt;\h1&gt;"; 
				descriptionText += "&lt;div&gt;Email: " + item.email + "&lt;\div&gt;";
				return descriptionText;
			}
		};
		new DynamicMenu(arguments);
	</pre>
	<p>
		With this setup, your menu will automatically update itself based on the "person" objects in the people array.
	</p>


	<h2>Using a Menu</h2>
	<h3>Accessing a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		When your document loads, abstract javascript models of your menus will be created. You can access them with the
		<span class="javascript">global_menus</span> variable. 
		To access your menu objects, use <span class="javascript">global_menus.getMenu(MENU_ID)</span>. 
		This function returns the menu object corresponding to the id you feed it!
	</p>
	<h3>Opening and Closing a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		To open or close your menu, simply call the function <span class="javascript">global_menus.toggle(MENU_ID)"</span>.
		You can only have one menu open at a time. If there is currently a different menu open, "toggle" will automatically close it before opening your menu. 
	</p>
	<h3>Selecting Items in a Menu</h3>
	<p>
		By default, the first item in a menu is selected. To select a different item, use the up and down arrow keys.
	</p>
	<p>
		To have the menu do something when you hit enter, you can set the <span class="javascript">onEnter</span> property of the menu object to the function you would like to execute. You can access the index of the selected item with the 
		<span class="javascript">this.getSelectedIndex()</span> method. You can get the text of the selected meny item with the 
		<span class="javascript">this.getSelectedText()</span> method. 
	</p>
